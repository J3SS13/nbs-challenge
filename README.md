# Data Visualization using D3.js and React.js
### Built for visualizing artist data from Next Big Sound

This web app is designed to work alone or as a component within a larger app.
It features a search bar, where a user can input an artist name, and get a bar chart, displaying their mean data for social media imprints.

I used several resources in building this application:

+ https://medium.com/turo-engineering/react-meets-d3-6a40881d0d73
+ https://d3js.org/

Once challenge I faced during this project was my inexperience working with D3. Much of the documentation I found was not specific to React, so this made some concepts more challenging to tackle. I recommend the resources above for using D3 in React.

In future stages of development, I would like to build out a more robust search. Additionally, I would like to include a more robust use from D3, as this visualization barely scratches the surface of what can be done.


Thank you to Next Big Sound for giving me access to their api!
