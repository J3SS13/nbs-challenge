#Data Visualization using D3.js and React.js
### built for Next Big Sound

This web app is designed to work alone or as a component within a larger app.
It features a search bar, where a user can input an artist name, and get a bar chart, displaying their mean data for social media imprints.

I used several resources in building this application:

+ https://medium.com/turo-engineering/react-meets-d3-6a40881d0d73
+ https://d3js.org/

Of of the challenges I faced was my inexperience working with D3. Much of the documentation I found were not specific to React, so this made some concepts more challenging to tackle.

In the next stages of development, I would like to build out a more robust search, which would account for words similar to the search match. Additionally, next steps, include making more robust use from D3, as this visualization barely scratches the surface of what is possible with D3.


Thank you to Next Big Sound for giving me access to their api!
